# Vue Vaul
This is a work in progress Vue port of [Vaul](https://vaul.emilkowal.ski/) by [emilkowalski](https://github.com/emilkowalski)

Feel free to help out however you want (PRs, issues, forking, copy/paste). If you do copy/paste or already have your own port, let me know, would love to check it out!

## To run
```
pnpm install
```

```
pnpm dev
```

Again this is very much a work in progress so any help or comments is appreciated!
